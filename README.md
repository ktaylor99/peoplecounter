# People Counter
This is a simple JavaScript application built using the guidance of Per Harald Borgen at freeCodeCamp.org. This simple app is fully responsive and can run on mobile devices without issue.

## Goal
My goal with this application was to further familiarize myself with JavaScript and how it interacts with elements on an HTML document.
